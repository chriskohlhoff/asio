asio to-do items
================

Add vectored send/recv functions
--------------------------------
Add the sendv and recvv functions to basic_stream_socket and presumably also to
the buffered stream templates.

Demuxer functions for event loop integration
--------------------------------------------
Add functions demuxer::work_pending() and demuxer::perform_work() that can be
used to integrate a demuxer event processing loop into an existing event loop.

SSL stream template
-------------------
Develop an ssl_stream<> decorator template that uses openssl to add encryption
support while preserving the ability to use asynchronous communication.
Apparently the BIO* functions can be used to do this.

Add a process control class
---------------------------
Add a class that allows you to do asynchronous operations waiting for process
termination and reconfiguration (i.e. using signals on UNIX, a Ctrl-C handler
or perhaps the service control manager on Windows).

Add standard input/output support
---------------------------------
Add the ability to do asynchronous I/O on standard input and output, e.g. to
wait for a user to type something. This would probably require the addition of
a WFMO reactor on Windows.

Add asynchronous file I/O support
---------------------------------
Add classes for doing file reads and writes asynchronously.

Add an asynchronous object manager
----------------------------------
Add a class to make it easier to manage objects such as sessions and close them
all down gracefully when a process needs to exit. When a session object starts
it would register with the object manager for an asynchronous shutdown
notification. If it receives this notification then it should cancel any other
outstanding asynchronous operations. If the object needs to die early it can
request that it be unregistered in which case it would receive the notification
immediately. Perhaps the interface is similar to an asynchronous "condition
variable"?

Add a rw_locking_dispatcher
---------------------------
Add a new dispatcher implementation, similar to locking_dispatcher except that
it provides functionality like a readers-writers lock.
