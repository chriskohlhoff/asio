\page tutdaytime1 Daytime.1 - A synchronous TCP daytime client

This tutorial program shows how to use asio to implement a client application
with TCP.

\dontinclude daytime1/client.cpp

We start by including the necessary header files.

\until #include "asio.hpp"

The purpose of this application is to access a daytime service,
so we need the user to specify the server.

\until }

All programs that use asio need to have at least one asio::demuxer object.

\until asio::demuxer

We need to turn the server name that was specified as a
parameter to the application, into an IP address. To do this we use an
asio::ipv4::host_resolver object.

\until asio::ipv4::host_resolver

Now we need an object of type asio::ipv4::host for the server.
The asio::ipv4::host_resolver::get_host_by_name() function takes a
hostname and populates the <tt>host</tt> object with the corresponding IP
address.

\until host_resolver.get_host_by_name

The socket is to connect to the daytime service, TCP port 13, on
the server. Create an object for this remote endpoint.

\until asio::ipv4::tcp::endpoint

Now create and connect the socket.

\until socket.connect

The connection is open. All we need to do now is read the
response from the daytime service. When the server closes the connection, the
asio::stream_socket::read() function will return 0, which is how we know to
exit the loop. If an error occurs during reading then an asio::error exception
is thrown.

\until }

Finally, handle any exceptions that may have been thrown.

\page tutdaytime2 Daytime.2 - A synchronous TCP daytime server

This tutorial program shows how to use asio to implement a server application
with TCP.

\dontinclude daytime2/server.cpp

\until asio::demuxer

An asio::socket_acceptor object needs to be created to listen
for new connections. It is initialised to listen on TCP port 13.

\until asio::socket_acceptor

This is an iterative server, which means that it will handle one
connection at a time. Create a socket that will represent the connection to the
client, and then wait for a connection.

\until acceptor.accept

A client is accessing our service. Determine the current time
and transfer this information to the client. 

\until }
\until }

Finally, handle any exceptions.

\section tutdaytime3funcmain The main() function

\dontinclude daytime3/server.cpp
\skip int main()
\until asio::socket_acceptor acceptor

We need to set up the initial socket to hold an accepted client connection.

\until asio::stream_socket*

The function asio::socket_acceptor::async_accept() will cause the
application to listen in the background for a new connection. When such a
connection is received, the demuxer will invoke the <tt>handle_accept()</tt>
function with an asio::error argument.

\until asio::placeholders::error

Now that we have created some work for it to do, we can run the demuxer.

\until return 0;
\until }

\section tutdaytime3funchandle_accept The handle_accept() function

The function <tt>handle_accept()</tt> will service the client request.

\dontinclude daytime3/server.cpp
\skip void handle_accept
\until {

The <tt>error</tt> parameter contains the result of the asynchronous operation.

\until {

Determine what we are going to send.

\until size_t write_length

We now call \ref async_write_n to serve the data to the client. Note that we
are using \ref async_write_n, rather than \ref async_write, to ensure that the
entire block of data is sent.

\until asio::placeholders::total_bytes_transferred

When initiating the asynchronous operation, and if using \ref boost_bind, you
must specify only the arguments that match the handler's parameter list. In
this program, all three of the argument placeholders
(asio::placeholders::error, asio::placeholders::last_bytes_transferred and
asio::placeholders::total_bytes_transferred) could potentially have been
removed.

Any further actions for this client connection are now the responsibility of
<tt>handle_write()</tt>.

Create a new socket for the next client connection.

\until }
\until }
\until }

\section tutdaytime3funchandle_write The handle_write() function

The function <tt>handle_write()</tt> is invoked after the service request has
been completed.

/**
\page tutdaytime4 Daytime.4 - A synchronous UDP daytime client

This tutorial program shows how to use asio to implement a client application
with UDP.

\dontinclude daytime4/client.cpp

The start of the application is essentially the same as for the TCP daytime
client.

\until host_resolver.get_host_by_name

Create an object for the remote endpoint, UDP port 13 on the server.

\until asio::ipv4::udp::endpoint

Since UDP is datagram-oriented, we will not be using a stream socket. Create an
asio::datagram_socket and initiate contact with the remote endpoint.

\until asio::buffer(send_buf,

Now we need to be ready to accept whatever the server sends back to us. The
endpoint on our side that receives the server's response will be initialised by
asio::datagram_socket::receive_from(). 

\until }

Finally, handle any exceptions that may have been thrown.

Create an asio::datagram_socket object to receive requests on UDP port 13.

\until asio::datagram_socket

The function asio::datagram_socket::async_receive_from() will cause the
application to listen in the background for a new request. When such a
request is received, the demuxer will invoke the <tt>handle_receive_from()</tt>
function with two arguments: asio::error, and bytes_transferred.

\until {

The <tt>error</tt> parameter contains the result of the asynchronous operation.
Since we only provided a 1-byte buffer to contain the client's request, the
demuxer would return an error if the client sent anything larger. We can ignore
such an error if it comes up.

\until {

Determine what we are going to send.

\until size_t send_length

We now call asio::datagram_socket::async_send_to() to serve the data to the
client.

\until asio::placeholders::bytes_transferred

When initiating the asynchronous operation, and if using \ref boost_bind, you
must specify only the arguments that match the handler's parameter list. In
this program, both of the argument placeholders (asio::placeholders::error and
asio::placeholders::bytes_transferred) could potentially have been removed.

Removed Bits

from Daytime.3:
\section tutdaytime3remunused Removing Unused Handler Parameters

You may have noticed that the <tt>error</tt>, <tt>last_bytes_sent</tt> and
<tt>total_bytes_sent</tt> parameters are not used in the body of the
<tt>handle_write()</tt> function. If parameters are not needed, it is possible
to remove them from the function:

Since <tt>handle_write()</tt> does not use the parameters <tt>error</tt>,
<tt>last_bytes_sent</tt> and <tt>total_bytes_sent</tt>, they have been removed
from the function.

from Daytime.6:
\section tutdaytime6remunused Removing Unused Handler Parameters

In this tutorial program, the <tt>error</tt> and <tt>bytes_sent</tt> parameters
are not used in the body of the <tt>handle_send_to()</tt> function. As those
parameters are not needed, they can be removed from the function:

@code
void handle_send_to(char* send_buf)
{
  using namespace std; // For free.
  free(send_buf);
} @endcode

When initiating the asynchronous operation, and if using \ref boost_bind, you
must specify only the arguments that match the handler's parameter list. In
this tutorial program, both of the argument placeholders
(asio::placeholders::error and asio::placeholders::bytes_transferred) should
therefore be removed:

@code
socket->async_send_to(asio::buffer(send_buf, send_length), *remote_address,
    boost::bind(handle_send_to, send_buf)); @endcode

The <tt>handle_recvfrom()</tt> functions's <tt>bytes_transferred</tt> parameter
can be similarly removed.
