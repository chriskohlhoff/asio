Some design notes:

\li <b>\ref designglossary</b>: Defines some terms used in the design and
implementation of Boost.Asio.

\li <b>\ref designproactor</b>: The Boost.Asio library is based on the Proactor
pattern. This design note outlines the advantages and disadvantages of this
approach.

\li <b>\ref designthreads</b>: An implementation of Boost.Asio for a particular
platform may make use of one or more additional threads to emulate
asynchronicity. This design note discusses design rules applied to the use of
threads in this way.

\li <b>\ref designservices</b>: This design note describes the pattern used for
structuring asynchronous object implementation.

\li <b>\ref designhandlers</b>: All asynchronous operations take a function
object that will be called when the operation completes. This design note
outlines the reasons for making the this handler type a template parameter,
rather than using boost::function.

\li <b>\ref designcloseascancel</b>: Asynchronous socket operations can be
cancelled by closing the socket. This design note describes why this approach
was selected rather than allowing individual operations to be cancelled.

\li <b>\ref designbuffers</b>: This design note examines the buffer abstraction
used by Boost.Asio in order to support scatter-gather operations.

\li <b>\ref designimplementation</b>: This design note lists platform-specific
implementation details, such as the default demultiplexing mechanism, the number
of threads created internally, and when threads are created.
