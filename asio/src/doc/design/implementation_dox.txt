\page designimplementation Platform-Specific Implementation

This design note lists platform-specific implementation details, such as the
default demultiplexing mechanism, the number of threads created internally, and
when threads are created.


\section linux24 Linux Kernel 2.4

\subsection linux24demux Demultiplexing Mechanism

Uses \c select for demultiplexing. This means that the number of file
descriptors in the process cannot be permitted to exceed FD_SETSIZE.

\subsection linux24threads Threads

Demultiplexing using \c select is performed in one of the threads that calls
asio::io_service::run().

An additional thread per io_service is used to emulate asynchronous host
resolution. This thread is created on the first call to either
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_address() or
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_name().


\section linux26 Linux Kernel 2.6

\subsection linux26demux Demultiplexing Mechanism

Uses \c epoll for demultiplexing.

\subsection linux26threads Threads

Demultiplexing using \c epoll is performed in one of the threads that calls
asio::io_service::run().

An additional thread per io_service is used to emulate asynchronous host
resolution. This thread is created on the first call to either
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_address() or
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_name().


\section solaris Solaris

\subsection solarisdemux Demultiplexing Mechanism

Uses \c select for demultiplexing. This means that the number of file
descriptors in the process cannot be permitted to exceed FD_SETSIZE.

\subsection solaristhreads Threads

Demultiplexing using \c select is performed in one of the threads that calls
asio::io_service::run().

An additional thread per io_service is used to emulate asynchronous host
resolution. This thread is created on the first call to either
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_address() or
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_name().


\section macosx Mac OS X

\subsection macosxdemux Demultiplexing Mechanism

Uses \c kqueue for demultiplexing.

\subsection macosxthreads Threads

Demultiplexing using \c kqueue is performed in one of the threads that calls
asio::io_service::run().

An additional thread per io_service is used to emulate asynchronous host
resolution. This thread is created on the first call to either
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_address() or
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_name().


\section win9x Windows 95, 98 and Me

\subsection win9xdemux Demultiplexing Mechanism

Uses \c select for demultiplexing.

\subsection win9xthreads Threads

Demultiplexing using \c select is performed in one of the threads that calls
asio::io_service::run().

An additional thread per io_service is used to emulate asynchronous host
resolution. This thread is created on the first call to either
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_address() or
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_name().


\section winnt Windows NT, 2000 and XP

\subsection winntdemux Demultiplexing Mechanism

Uses overlapped I/O and I/O completion ports for all asynchronous
datagram_socket, stream_socket and socket_acceptor operations except for
asynchronous connect.

Uses \c select for deadline_timer operations and for emulating asynchronous
connect.

\subsection winnthreads Threads

Demultiplexing using I/O completion ports is performed in all threads that call
asio::io_service::run().

An additional thread per io_service is used to for the \c select demultiplexing.
This thread is created whenever the first deadline_timer, datagram_socket,
stream_socket or socket_acceptor is created.

An additional thread per io_service is used to emulate asynchronous host
resolution. This thread is created on the first call to either
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_address() or
asio::ipv4::host_resolver::async_get_host_by_name().
