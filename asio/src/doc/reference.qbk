[variablelist
  
[[ios][The io\_service object that owns the service.]]

[[svc][The service object. On success, ownership of the service object is transferred to the io\_service. When the io\_service object is destroyed, it will destroy the service object by performing: 
``
   delete static_cast<io_service::service*>(svc)

[section:asio_handler_allocate asio_handler_allocate]

[indexterm1 asio_handler_allocate] Default allocation function for handlers. 

  void * asio_handler_allocate(
      std::size_t size,
      ... );


Asynchronous operations may need to allocate temporary objects. Since asynchronous operations have a handler function object, these temporary objects can be said to be associated with the handler.

Implement asio\_handler\_allocate and asio\_handler\_deallocate for your own handlers to provide custom allocation for these temporary objects.

This default implementation is simply: 

   return ::operator new(size);





[heading Remarks]
      
All temporary objects associated with a handler will be deallocated before the upcall to the handler is performed. This allows the same memory to be reused for a subsequent asynchronous operation initiated by the handler.

[heading Example]
  


   class my_handler;

   void* asio_handler_allocate(std::size_t size, my_handler* context)
   {
     return ::operator new(size);
   }

   void asio_handler_deallocate(void* pointer, std::size_t size,
       my_handler* context)
   {
     ::operator delete(pointer);
   }






[endsect]



[section:asio_handler_deallocate asio_handler_deallocate]

[indexterm1 asio_handler_deallocate] Default deallocation function for handlers. 

  void asio_handler_deallocate(
      void * pointer,
      std::size_t size,
      ... );


Implement asio\_handler\_allocate and asio\_handler\_deallocate for your own handlers to provide custom allocation for the associated temporary objects.

This default implementation is simply: 

   ::operator delete(pointer);







[endsect]



[section:asio_handler_invoke asio_handler_invoke]

[indexterm1 asio_handler_invoke] Default invoke function for handlers. 

  template<
      typename Function>
  void asio_handler_invoke(
      Function function,
      ... );


Completion handlers for asynchronous operations are invoked by the io_service associated with the corresponding object (e.g. a socket or deadline\_timer). Certain guarantees are made on when the handler may be invoked, in particular that a handler can only be invoked from a thread that is currently calling asio::io\_service::run() on the corresponding io_service object. Handlers may subsequently be invoked through other objects (such as asio::strand objects) that provide additional guarantees.

When asynchronous operations are composed from other asynchronous operations, all intermediate handlers should be invoked using the same method as the final handler. This is required to ensure that user-defined objects are not accessed in a way that may violate the guarantees. This hooking function ensures that the invoked method used for the final handler is accessible at each intermediate step.

Implement asio\_handler\_invoke for your own handlers to specify a custom invocation strategy.

This default implementation is simply: 

   function();





[heading Example]
  


   class my_handler;

   template <typename Function>
   void asio_handler_invoke(Function function, my_handler* context)
   {
     context->strand_.dispatch(function);
   }

This function is used to asynchronously read a certain number of bytes of data from a stream. The function call always returns immediately. The asynchronous operation will continue until one of the following conditions is true:


* The supplied buffers are full. That is, the bytes transferred is equal to the sum of the buffer sizes.

[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be read. The sum of the buffer sizes indicates the maximum number of bytes to read from the stream. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the read operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``

This function is used to asynchronously read data into the specified streambuf until a user-defined match condition function object, when applied to the data contained in the streambuf, indicates a successful match. The function call always returns immediately. The asynchronous operation will continue until one of the following conditions is true:


* The match condition function object returns a std::pair where the second element evaluates to true.

* An error occurred.

This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's async\_read\_some function. If the match condition function object already indicates a match, the operation completes immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist

``
where `iterator` represents the type: 
``
   buffers_iterator<basic_streambuf<Allocator>::const_buffers_type>
``
The iterator parameters `begin` and `end` define the range of bytes to be scanned to determine whether there is a match. The `first` member of the return value is an iterator marking one-past-the-end of the bytes that have been consumed by the match function. This iterator is used to calculate the `begin` parameter for any subsequent invocation of the match condition. The `second` member of the return value is true if a match has been found, false otherwise.]]

[heading Remarks]
      
After a successful async\_read\_until operation, the streambuf may contain additional data beyond that which matched the function object. An application will typically leave that data in the streambuf for a subsequent async\_read\_until operation to examine.

The default implementation of the `is_match_condition` type trait evaluates to true for function pointers and function objects with a `result_type` typedef. It must be specialised for other user-defined function objects.

[heading Examples]
  
To asynchronously read data into a streambuf until whitespace is encountered: 

   typedef asio::buffers_iterator<

   void handler(const asio::error_code& e, std::size_t size);
   ...
   asio::streambuf b;
   asio::async_read_until(s, b, match_whitespace, handler);




To asynchronously read data into a streambuf until a matching character is found:

[variablelist
  
[[s][The stream to which the data is to be written. The type must support the AsyncWriteStream concept.]]

[[buffers][One or more buffers containing the data to be written. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[completion_condition][The function object to be called to determine whether the write operation is complete. The signature of the function object must be: 
``
   std::size_t completion_condition(
     // Result of latest async_write_some operation.
     const asio::error_code& error,

     // Number of bytes transferred so far.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred
   ); 
``
A return value of 0 indicates that the write operation is complete. A non-zero return value indicates the maximum number of bytes to be written on the next call to the stream's async\_write\_some function.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the write operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.

     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes written from the
                                             // buffers. If an error occurred,
                                             // this will be less than the sum
                                             // of the buffer sizes.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

[heading Example]
  
To write a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   asio::async_write(s,
       asio::buffer(data, size),
       asio::transfer_at_least(32),

[indexterm2 async_connect..basic_datagram_socket] Start an asynchronous connect. 

  void async_connect(

      ConnectHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously connect a socket to the specified remote endpoint. The function call always returns immediately.

The socket is automatically opened if it is not already open. If the connect fails, and the socket was automatically opened, the socket is not returned to the closed state.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[peer_endpoint][The remote endpoint to which the socket will be connected. Copies will be made of the endpoint object as required.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the connection operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error // Result of operation
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

This function is used to asynchronously receive data from the datagram socket. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be received. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the receive operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.

['Inherited from basic_socket.]

Cancel all asynchronous operations associated with the socket. 

  void cancel();


This function causes all outstanding asynchronous connect, send and receive operations to finish immediately, and the handlers for cancelled operations will be passed the asio::error::operation\_aborted error.


[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure.]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
Calls to cancel() will always fail with asio::error::operation\_not\_supported when run on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and earlier versions of Windows, unless ASIO\_ENABLE\_CANCELIO is defined. However, the CancelIo function has two issues that should be considered before enabling its use:

* It will only cancel asynchronous operations that were initiated in the current thread.

* It can appear to complete without error, but the request to cancel the unfinished operations may be silently ignored by the operating system. Whether it works or not seems to depend on the drivers that are installed.

For portable cancellation, consider using one of the following alternatives:


* Disable asio's I/O completion port backend by defining ASIO_DISABLE_IOCP.

* Use the close() function to simultaneously cancel the outstanding operations and close the socket.

When running on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later, the CancelIoEx function is always used. This function does not have the problems described above.

The basic_deadline_timer class template provides the ability to perform a blocking or asynchronous wait for a timer to expire.

Most applications will use the asio::deadline\_timer typedef.


[heading Thread Safety]
  
[*Distinct] [*objects:]  Safe.

[*Shared] [*objects:]  Unsafe.

[heading Examples]
  
Performing a blocking wait: 

   // Construct a timer without setting an expiry time.
   asio::deadline_timer timer(io_service);

   // Set an expiry time relative to now.
   timer.expires_from_now(boost::posix_time::seconds(5));

   // Wait for the timer to expire.
   timer.wait();




Performing an asynchronous wait: 

   void handler(const asio::error_code& error)
   {
     if (!error)
     {
       // Timer expired.
     }
   }

   ...

   // Construct a timer with an absolute expiry time.
   asio::deadline_timer timer(io_service,
       boost::posix_time::time_from_string("2005-12-07 23:59:59.000"));

   // Start an asynchronous wait.
   timer.async_wait(handler);




[heading Changing an active deadline_timer's expiry time]
  


Changing the expiry time of a timer while there are pending asynchronous waits causes those wait operations to be cancelled. To ensure that the action associated with the timer is performed only once, use something like this: used:



   void on_some_event()
   {
     if (my_timer.expires_from_now(seconds(5)) > 0)
     {
       // We managed to cancel the timer. Start new asynchronous wait.
       my_timer.async_wait(on_timeout);
     }
     else
     {
       // Too late, timer has already expired!
     }
   }

   void on_timeout(const asio::error_code& e)
   {
     if (e != asio::error::operation_aborted)
     {
       // Timer was not cancelled, take necessary action.
     }
   }





* The asio::basic_deadline_timer::expires_from_now() function cancels any pending asynchronous waits, and returns the number of asynchronous waits that were cancelled. If it returns 0 then you were too late and the wait handler has already been executed, or will soon be executed. If it returns 1 then the wait handler was successfully cancelled.

* If a wait handler is cancelled, the asio::error_code passed to it contains the value asio::error::operation_aborted. 



[section:async_wait basic_deadline_timer::async_wait]

[indexterm2 async_wait..basic_deadline_timer] Start an asynchronous wait on the timer. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.WaitHandler WaitHandler]``>
  void async_wait(
      WaitHandler handler);


This function may be used to initiate an asynchronous wait against the timer. It always returns immediately.

For each call to async\_wait(), the supplied handler will be called exactly once. The handler will be called when:


* The timer has expired.

* The timer was cancelled, in which case the handler is passed the error code asio::error::operation_aborted.

[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[handler][The handler to be called when the timer expires. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error // Result of operation.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post(). ]]

  void async_receive(
      const MutableBufferSequence & buffers,
      ReadHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously receive data from the raw socket. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be received. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the receive operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes received.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The async\_receive operation can only be used with a connected socket. Use the async\_receive\_from function to receive data on an unconnected raw socket.

[heading Example]
  
To receive into a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   socket.async_receive(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on receiving into multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

[section:cancel basic_raw_socket::cancel]

[indexterm2 cancel..basic_raw_socket] Cancel all asynchronous operations associated with the socket. 

  void ``[link asio.reference.basic_raw_socket.cancel.overload1 cancel]``();

  asio::error_code ``[link asio.reference.basic_raw_socket.cancel.overload2 cancel]``(
      asio::error_code & ec);


[section:overload1 basic_raw_socket::cancel (1 of 2 overloads)]


['Inherited from basic_socket.]

Cancel all asynchronous operations associated with the socket. 

  void cancel();


This function causes all outstanding asynchronous connect, send and receive operations to finish immediately, and the handlers for cancelled operations will be passed the asio::error::operation\_aborted error.


[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure.]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
Calls to cancel() will always fail with asio::error::operation\_not\_supported when run on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and earlier versions of Windows, unless ASIO\_ENABLE\_CANCELIO is defined. However, the CancelIo function has two issues that should be considered before enabling its use:

* It will only cancel asynchronous operations that were initiated in the current thread.

* It can appear to complete without error, but the request to cancel the unfinished operations may be silently ignored by the operating system. Whether it works or not seems to depend on the drivers that are installed.

For portable cancellation, consider using one of the following alternatives:


* Disable asio's I/O completion port backend by defining ASIO_DISABLE_IOCP.

* Use the close() function to simultaneously cancel the outstanding operations and close the socket.

When running on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later, the CancelIoEx function is always used. This function does not have the problems described above.

[section:async_read_some basic_serial_port::async_read_some]

[indexterm2 async_read_some..basic_serial_port] Start an asynchronous read. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.MutableBufferSequence MutableBufferSequence]``,
      typename ``[link asio.reference.ReadHandler ReadHandler]``>
  void async_read_some(
      const MutableBufferSequence & buffers,
      ReadHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously read data from the serial port. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be read. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the read operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes read.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The read operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_read async_read]  function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To read into a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   serial_port.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on reading into multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

      typename ``[link asio.reference.WriteHandler WriteHandler]``>
  void async_write_some(
      const ConstBufferSequence & buffers,
      WriteHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously write data to the serial port. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more data buffers to be written to the serial port. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the write operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes written.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The write operation may not transmit all of the data to the peer. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_write async_write]  function if you need to ensure that all data is written before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To write a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   serial_port.async_write_some(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on writing multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

      ConnectHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously connect a socket to the specified remote endpoint. The function call always returns immediately.

The socket is automatically opened if it is not already open. If the connect fails, and the socket was automatically opened, the socket is not returned to the closed state.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[peer_endpoint][The remote endpoint to which the socket will be connected. Copies will be made of the endpoint object as required.]]

``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error // Result of operation
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

[section:overload1 basic_socket::cancel (1 of 2 overloads)]

Cancel all asynchronous operations associated with the socket. 

  void cancel();

[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure.]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
Calls to cancel() will always fail with asio::error::operation\_not\_supported when run on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and earlier versions of Windows, unless ASIO\_ENABLE\_CANCELIO is defined. However, the CancelIo function has two issues that should be considered before enabling its use:

* It will only cancel asynchronous operations that were initiated in the current thread.

* It can appear to complete without error, but the request to cancel the unfinished operations may be silently ignored by the operating system. Whether it works or not seems to depend on the drivers that are installed.

For portable cancellation, consider using one of the following alternatives:


* Disable asio's I/O completion port backend by defining ASIO_DISABLE_IOCP.

* Use the close() function to simultaneously cancel the outstanding operations and close the socket.

When running on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later, the CancelIoEx function is always used. This function does not have the problems described above.

  asio::error_code ``[link asio.reference.basic_socket_streambuf.cancel.overload2 cancel]``(
      asio::error_code & ec);


[section:overload1 basic_socket_streambuf::cancel (1 of 2 overloads)]


['Inherited from basic_socket.]

Cancel all asynchronous operations associated with the socket. 

  void cancel();


This function causes all outstanding asynchronous connect, send and receive operations to finish immediately, and the handlers for cancelled operations will be passed the asio::error::operation\_aborted error.


[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure.]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
Calls to cancel() will always fail with asio::error::operation\_not\_supported when run on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and earlier versions of Windows, unless ASIO\_ENABLE\_CANCELIO is defined. However, the CancelIo function has two issues that should be considered before enabling its use:

* It will only cancel asynchronous operations that were initiated in the current thread.

* It can appear to complete without error, but the request to cancel the unfinished operations may be silently ignored by the operating system. Whether it works or not seems to depend on the drivers that are installed.

For portable cancellation, consider using one of the following alternatives:


* Disable asio's I/O completion port backend by defining ASIO_DISABLE_IOCP.

* Use the close() function to simultaneously cancel the outstanding operations and close the socket.

When running on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later, the CancelIoEx function is always used. This function does not have the problems described above.

[section:async_connect basic_stream_socket::async_connect]


['Inherited from basic_socket.]

[indexterm2 async_connect..basic_stream_socket] Start an asynchronous connect. 

  void async_connect(
      const endpoint_type & peer_endpoint,
      ConnectHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously connect a socket to the specified remote endpoint. The function call always returns immediately.

The socket is automatically opened if it is not already open. If the connect fails, and the socket was automatically opened, the socket is not returned to the closed state.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[peer_endpoint][The remote endpoint to which the socket will be connected. Copies will be made of the endpoint object as required.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the connection operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error // Result of operation
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Example]
  


   void connect_handler(const asio::error_code& error)
   {
     if (!error)
     {
       // Connect succeeded.

      typename ``[link asio.reference.ReadHandler ReadHandler]``>
  void async_read_some(
      const MutableBufferSequence & buffers,
      ReadHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously read data from the stream socket. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be read. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the read operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes read.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The read operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_read async_read]  function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To read into a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   socket.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);

[section:overload1 basic_stream_socket::cancel (1 of 2 overloads)]


['Inherited from basic_socket.]

Cancel all asynchronous operations associated with the socket. 

  void cancel();


This function causes all outstanding asynchronous connect, send and receive operations to finish immediately, and the handlers for cancelled operations will be passed the asio::error::operation\_aborted error.


[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure.]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
Calls to cancel() will always fail with asio::error::operation\_not\_supported when run on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and earlier versions of Windows, unless ASIO\_ENABLE\_CANCELIO is defined. However, the CancelIo function has two issues that should be considered before enabling its use:

* It will only cancel asynchronous operations that were initiated in the current thread.

* It can appear to complete without error, but the request to cancel the unfinished operations may be silently ignored by the operating system. Whether it works or not seems to depend on the drivers that are installed.

For portable cancellation, consider using one of the following alternatives:


* Disable asio's I/O completion port backend by defining ASIO_DISABLE_IOCP.

* Use the close() function to simultaneously cancel the outstanding operations and close the socket.

When running on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later, the CancelIoEx function is always used. This function does not have the problems described above.

      typename ``[link asio.reference.ConstBufferSequence ConstBufferSequence]``>
  std::size_t send(
      const ConstBufferSequence & buffers,
      socket_base::message_flags flags,
      asio::error_code & ec);


This function is used to send data on the stream socket. The function call will block until one or more bytes of the data has been sent successfully, or an until error occurs.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more data buffers to be sent on the socket.]]

[[flags][Flags specifying how the send call is to be made.]]

[[ec][Set to indicate what error occurred, if any.]]

]

[heading Return Value]
      
The number of bytes sent. Returns 0 if an error occurred.

[heading Remarks]
      
The send operation may not transmit all of the data to the peer. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.write write]  function if you need to ensure that all data is written before the blocking operation completes.

A buffer object represents a contiguous region of memory as a 2-tuple consisting of a pointer and size in bytes. A tuple of the form `{void*, size_t}` specifies a mutable (modifiable) region of memory. Similarly, a tuple of the form `{const void*, size_t}` specifies a const (non-modifiable) region of memory. These two forms correspond to the classes mutable_buffer and const_buffer, respectively. To mirror C++'s conversion rules, a mutable_buffer is implicitly convertible to a const_buffer, and the opposite conversion is not permitted.

The simplest use case involves reading or writing a single buffer of a specified size:



   sock.send(asio::buffer(data, size)); 




In the above example, the return value of asio::buffer meets the requirements of the ConstBufferSequence concept so that it may be directly passed to the socket's write function. A buffer created for modifiable memory also meets the requirements of the MutableBufferSequence concept.

An individual buffer may be created from a builtin array, std::vector or boost::array of POD elements. This helps prevent buffer overruns by automatically determining the size of the buffer:



   char d1[128];
   size_t bytes_transferred = sock.receive(asio::buffer(d1));

   std::vector<char> d2(128);
   bytes_transferred = sock.receive(asio::buffer(d2));

   boost::array<char, 128> d3;
   bytes_transferred = sock.receive(asio::buffer(d3)); 




In all three cases above, the buffers created are exactly 128 bytes long. Note that a vector is [*never]  automatically resized when creating or using a buffer. The buffer size is determined using the vector's `size()` member function, and not its capacity.


[heading Accessing Buffer Contents]
  


The contents of a buffer may be accessed using the asio::buffer\_size and asio::buffer\_cast functions:



   asio::mutable_buffer b1 = ...;
   std::size_t s1 = asio::buffer_size(b1);
   unsigned char* p1 = asio::buffer_cast<unsigned char*>(b1);

   asio::const_buffer b2 = ...;
   std::size_t s2 = asio::buffer_size(b2);
   const void* p2 = asio::buffer_cast<const void*>(b2); 




The asio::buffer\_cast function permits violations of type safety, so uses of it in application code should be carefully considered.


[heading Buffer Invalidation]
  


A buffer object does not have any ownership of the memory it refers to. It is the responsibility of the application to ensure the memory region remains valid until it is no longer required for an I/O operation. When the memory is no longer available, the buffer is said to have been invalidated.

For the asio::buffer overloads that accept an argument of type std::vector, the buffer objects returned are invalidated by any vector operation that also invalidates all references, pointers and iterators referring to the elements in the sequence (C++ Std, 23.2.4)

For the asio::buffer overloads that accept an argument of type std::string, the buffer objects returned are invalidated according to the rules defined for invalidation of references, pointers and iterators referring to elements of the sequence (C++ Std, 21.3).


[heading Buffer Arithmetic]
  


Buffer objects may be manipulated using simple arithmetic in a safe way which helps prevent buffer overruns. Consider an array initialised as follows:



   boost::array<char, 6> a = { 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' }; 




A buffer object `b1` created using:



   b1 = asio::buffer(a); 




represents the entire array, `{ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' }`. An optional second argument to the asio::buffer function may be used to limit the size, in bytes, of the buffer:



   b2 = asio::buffer(a, 3); 




such that `b2` represents the data `{ 'a', 'b', 'c' }`. Even if the size argument exceeds the actual size of the array, the size of the buffer object created will be limited to the array size.

An offset may be applied to an existing buffer to create a new one:



   b3 = b1 + 2; 




where `b3` will set to represent `{ 'c', 'd', 'e' }`. If the offset exceeds the size of the existing buffer, the newly created buffer will be empty.

Both an offset and size may be specified to create a buffer that corresponds to a specific range of bytes within an existing buffer:



   b4 = asio::buffer(b1 + 1, 3); 




so that `b4` will refer to the bytes `{ 'b', 'c', 'd' }`.


[heading Buffers and Scatter-Gather I/O]
  


To read or write using multiple buffers (i.e. scatter-gather I/O), multiple buffer objects may be assigned into a container that supports the MutableBufferSequence (for read) or ConstBufferSequence (for write) concepts:



   char d1[128];
   std::vector<char> d2(128);
   boost::array<char, 128> d3;

   boost::array<mutable_buffer, 3> bufs1 = {
     asio::buffer(d1),
     asio::buffer(d2),
     asio::buffer(d3) };
   bytes_transferred = sock.receive(bufs1);

   std::vector<const_buffer> bufs2;
   bufs2.push_back(asio::buffer(d1));
   bufs2.push_back(asio::buffer(d2));
   bufs2.push_back(asio::buffer(d3));
   bytes_transferred = sock.send(bufs2);

The basic_deadline_timer class template provides the ability to perform a blocking or asynchronous wait for a timer to expire.

Most applications will use the asio::deadline\_timer typedef.


[heading Thread Safety]
  
[*Distinct] [*objects:]  Safe.

[*Shared] [*objects:]  Unsafe.

[heading Examples]
  
Performing a blocking wait: 

   // Construct a timer without setting an expiry time.
   asio::deadline_timer timer(io_service);

   // Set an expiry time relative to now.
   timer.expires_from_now(boost::posix_time::seconds(5));

   // Wait for the timer to expire.
   timer.wait();




Performing an asynchronous wait: 

   void handler(const asio::error_code& error)
   {
     if (!error)
     {
       // Timer expired.
     }
   }

   ...

   // Construct a timer with an absolute expiry time.
   asio::deadline_timer timer(io_service,
       boost::posix_time::time_from_string("2005-12-07 23:59:59.000"));

   // Start an asynchronous wait.
   timer.async_wait(handler);




[heading Changing an active deadline_timer's expiry time]
  


Changing the expiry time of a timer while there are pending asynchronous waits causes those wait operations to be cancelled. To ensure that the action associated with the timer is performed only once, use something like this: used:



   void on_some_event()
   {
     if (my_timer.expires_from_now(seconds(5)) > 0)
     {
       // We managed to cancel the timer. Start new asynchronous wait.
       my_timer.async_wait(on_timeout);
     }
     else
     {
       // Too late, timer has already expired!
     }
   }

   void on_timeout(const asio::error_code& e)
   {
     if (e != asio::error::operation_aborted)
     {
       // Timer was not cancelled, take necessary action.
     }
   }





* The asio::basic_deadline_timer::expires_from_now() function cancels any pending asynchronous waits, and returns the number of asynchronous waits that were cancelled. If it returns 0 then you were too late and the wait handler has already been executed, or will soon be executed. If it returns 1 then the wait handler was successfully cancelled.

* If a wait handler is cancelled, the asio::error_code passed to it contains the value asio::error::operation_aborted.

The io_service class provides the core I/O functionality for users of the asynchronous I/O objects, including:


* asio::ip::tcp::socket

* asio::ip::tcp::acceptor

* asio::ip::udp::socket

* asio::deadline_timer.

The io_service class also includes facilities intended for developers of custom asynchronous services.


[heading Thread Safety]
  
[*Distinct] [*objects:]  Safe.

[*Shared] [*objects:]  Safe, with the exception that calling reset() while there are unfinished run() calls results in undefined behaviour.

[heading Effect of exceptions thrown from handlers]
  


If an exception is thrown from a handler, the exception is allowed to propagate through the throwing thread's invocation of asio::io\_service::run(), asio::io\_service::run\_one(), asio::io\_service::poll() or asio::io\_service::poll\_one(). No other threads that are calling any of these functions are affected. It is then the responsibility of the application to catch the exception.

After the exception has been caught, the asio::io\_service::run(), asio::io\_service::run\_one(), asio::io\_service::poll() or asio::io\_service::poll\_one() call may be restarted [*without]  the need for an intervening call to asio::io\_service::reset(). This allows the thread to rejoin the io\_service's thread pool without impacting any other threads in the pool.

For example:



   asio::io_service io_service;
   ...
   for (;;)
   {
     try
     {
       io_service.run();
       break; // run() exited normally
     }
     catch (my_exception& e)
     {
       // Deal with exception as appropriate.
     }
   }





[heading Stopping the io_service from running out of work]
  


Some applications may need to prevent an io\_service's run() call from returning when there is no more work to do. For example, the io_service may be being run in a background thread that is launched prior to the application's asynchronous operations. The run() call may be kept running by creating an object of type 
[link asio.reference.io_service__work io_service::work]:



   asio::io_service io_service;
   asio::io_service::work work(io_service);
   ... 




To effect a shutdown, the application will then need to call the io\_service's stop() member function. This will cause the io_servicerun() call to return as soon as possible, abandoning unfinished operations and without permitting ready handlers to be dispatched.

Alternatively, if the application requires that all operations and handlers be allowed to finish normally, the work object may be explicitly destroyed.



   asio::io_service io_service;
   auto_ptr<asio::io_service::work> work(
       new asio::io_service::work(io_service));
   ...
   work.reset(); // Allow run() to exit. 





[section:add_service io_service::add_service]

[indexterm2 add_service..io_service] Add a service object to the io_service. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.Service Service]``>

The run() function blocks until all work has finished and there are no more handlers to be dispatched, or until the io_service has been stopped.

Multiple threads may call the run() function to set up a pool of threads from which the io_service may execute handlers. All threads that are waiting in the pool are equivalent and the io_service may choose any one of them to invoke a handler.

The run() function may be safely called again once it has completed only after a call to reset().


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[ec][Set to indicate what error occurred, if any.]]

]

[heading Return Value]
      
The number of handlers that were executed.

[heading Remarks]
      
The poll() function may also be used to dispatch ready handlers, but without blocking.

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.Service Service]``>
  friend Service & use_service(
      io_service & ios);


This function is used to locate a service object that corresponds to the given service type. If there is no existing implementation of the service, then the io_service will create a new instance of the service.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[ios][The io\_service object that owns the service.]]

A function object that, when invoked, passes the wrapped handler to the io\_service's dispatch function. Given a function object with the signature: 

   R f(A1 a1, ... An an); 


If this function object is passed to the wrap function like so: 

   io_service.wrap(f); 


then the return value is a function object with the signature 

   void g(A1 a1, ... An an); 


that, when invoked, executes code equivalent to: 

   io_service.dispatch(boost::bind(f, a1, ... an));

The io_service::strand class provides the ability to post and dispatch handlers with the guarantee that none of those handlers will execute concurrently.


[heading Thread Safety]
  
[*Distinct] [*objects:]  Safe.

[*Shared] [*objects:]  Safe.



[section:dispatch io_service::strand::dispatch]

[indexterm2 dispatch..io_service::strand] Request the strand to invoke the given handler. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.Handler Handler]``>
  void dispatch(
      Handler handler);


This function is used to ask the strand to execute the given handler.

The strand object guarantees that handlers posted or dispatched through the strand will not be executed concurrently. The handler may be executed inside this function if the guarantee can be met. If this function is called from within a handler that was posted or dispatched through the same strand, then the new handler will be executed immediately.

The strand's guarantee is in addition to the guarantee provided by the underlying io_service. The io_service guarantees that the handler will only be called in a thread in which the io\_service's run member function is currently being invoked.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[handler][The handler to be called. The strand will make a copy of the handler object as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler();

[section:post io_service::strand::post]

[indexterm2 post..io_service::strand] Request the strand to invoke the given handler and return immediately. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.Handler Handler]``>
  void post(
      Handler handler);


This function is used to ask the strand to execute the given handler, but without allowing the strand to call the handler from inside this function.

The strand object guarantees that handlers posted or dispatched through the strand will not be executed concurrently. The strand's guarantee is in addition to the guarantee provided by the underlying io_service. The io_service guarantees that the handler will only be called in a thread in which the io\_service's run member function is currently being invoked.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist

  unspecified wrap(
      Handler handler);


This function is used to create a new handler function object that, when invoked, will automatically pass the wrapped handler to the strand's dispatch function.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[handler][The handler to be wrapped. The strand will make a copy of the handler object as required. The function signature of the handler must be:
``
   void handler(A1 a1, ... An an); 
``
]]

]

[heading Return Value]
      
A function object that, when invoked, passes the wrapped handler to the strand's dispatch function. Given a function object with the signature: 

   R f(A1 a1, ... An an); 


If this function object is passed to the wrap function like so: 

   strand.wrap(f); 


then the return value is a function object with the signature 

   void g(A1 a1, ... An an); 


that, when invoked, executes code equivalent to: 

   strand.dispatch(boost::bind(f, a1, ... an)); 






[endsect]



[section:_strand io_service::strand::~strand]

[indexterm2 ~strand..io_service::strand] Destructor.

[link asio.reference.async_read async_read]  function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To read into a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   descriptor.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on reading into multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

[section:async_write_some posix::basic_stream_descriptor::async_write_some]

[indexterm2 async_write_some..posix::basic_stream_descriptor] Start an asynchronous write. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.ConstBufferSequence ConstBufferSequence]``,
      typename ``[link asio.reference.WriteHandler WriteHandler]``>
  void async_write_some(
      const ConstBufferSequence & buffers,
      WriteHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously write data to the stream descriptor. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more data buffers to be written to the descriptor. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the write operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes written.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The write operation may not transmit all of the data to the peer. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_write async_write]  function if you need to ensure that all data is written before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To write a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   descriptor.async_write_some(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on writing multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

This function is used to read a certain number of bytes of data from a stream. The call will block until one of the following conditions is true:


* The supplied buffers are full. That is, the bytes transferred is equal to the sum of the buffer sizes.

* An error occurred.

This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's read\_some function.

The stream class template provides asynchronous and blocking stream-oriented functionality using SSL.


[heading Thread Safety]
  
[*Distinct] [*objects:]  Safe.

[*Shared] [*objects:]  Unsafe.

[heading Example]
  
To use the SSL stream template with an ip::tcp::socket, you would write: 

   asio::io_service io_service;
   asio::ssl::context context(io_service, asio::ssl::context::sslv23);
   asio::ssl::stream<asio::ip::tcp::socket> sock(io_service, context);






[section:async_handshake ssl::stream::async_handshake]

[indexterm2 async_handshake..ssl::stream] Start an asynchronous SSL handshake. 

  template<
      typename HandshakeHandler>
  void async_handshake(
      handshake_type type,
      HandshakeHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously perform an SSL handshake on the stream. This function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[type][The type of handshaking to be performed, i.e. as a client or as a server.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the handshake operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The equivalent function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error // Result of operation.
   ); 
``
]]

]



[endsect]



[section:async_read_some ssl::stream::async_read_some]

[indexterm2 async_read_some..ssl::stream] Start an asynchronous read. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.MutableBufferSequence MutableBufferSequence]``,
      typename ``[link asio.reference.ReadHandler ReadHandler]``>
  void async_read_some(
      const MutableBufferSequence & buffers,
      ReadHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously read one or more bytes of data from the stream. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][The buffers into which the data will be read. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying buffers is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the read operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The equivalent function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes read.
   ); 
``
]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The async\_read\_some operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_read async_read]  function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation completes.

``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error // Result of operation.
   ); 
``
]]

]



[endsect]



[section:async_write_some ssl::stream::async_write_some]

[indexterm2 async_write_some..ssl::stream] Start an asynchronous write.

  void async_write_some(
      const ConstBufferSequence & buffers,
      WriteHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously write one or more bytes of data to the stream. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][The data to be written to the stream. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying buffers is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the write operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The equivalent function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes written.
   ); 
``
]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The async\_write\_some operation may not transmit all of the data to the peer. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_write async_write]  function if you need to ensure that all data is written before the blocking operation completes.

[heading Member Functions]
[table

    [Destructor. ]
  ]
  
]

The 
[link asio.reference.thread thread] class implements the smallest possible subset of the functionality of boost::thread. It is intended to be used only for starting a thread and waiting for it to exit. If more extensive threading capabilities are required, you are strongly advised to use something else.


[heading Thread Safety]
  
[*Distinct] [*objects:]  Safe.

[*Shared] [*objects:]  Unsafe.

[heading Example]
  
A typical use of 
[link asio.reference.thread thread] would be to launch a thread to run an io\_service's event processing loop:



   asio::io_service io_service;
   // ...
   asio::thread t(boost::bind(&asio::io_service::run, &io_service));
   // ...
   t.join(); 






[section:join thread::join]

[indexterm2 join..thread] Wait for the thread to exit. 

  void join();


This function will block until the thread has exited.

If this function is not called before the thread object is destroyed, the thread itself will continue to run until completion. You will, however, no longer have the ability to wait for it to exit.

  void async_read_some_at(
      boost::uint64_t offset,
      const MutableBufferSequence & buffers,
      ReadHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously read data from the random-access handle. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[offset][The offset at which the data will be read.]]

[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be read. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the read operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes read.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The read operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_read_at async_read_at]  function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To read into a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   handle.async_read_some_at(42, asio::buffer(data, size), handler);


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on reading into multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

  void async_write_some_at(
      boost::uint64_t offset,
      const ConstBufferSequence & buffers,
      WriteHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously write data to the random-access handle. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[offset][The offset at which the data will be written.]]

[[buffers][One or more data buffers to be written to the handle. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the write operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes written.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The write operation may not transmit all of the data to the peer. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_write_at async_write_at]  function if you need to ensure that all data is written before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To write a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   handle.async_write_some_at(42, asio::buffer(data, size), handler);


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on writing multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

      typename ``[link asio.reference.ReadHandler ReadHandler]``>
  void async_read_some(
      const MutableBufferSequence & buffers,
      ReadHandler handler);


This function is used to asynchronously read data from the stream handle. The function call always returns immediately.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be read. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the read operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be: 
``
   void handler(
     const asio::error_code& error, // Result of operation.
     std::size_t bytes_transferred           // Number of bytes read.
   ); 
``
Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a manner equivalent to using asio::io\_service::post().]]

]

[heading Remarks]
      
The read operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.async_read async_read]  function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the asynchronous operation completes.

[heading Example]
  
To read into a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   handle.async_read_some(asio::buffer(data, size), handler);

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more data buffers to be written to the handle. Although the buffers object may be copied as necessary, ownership of the underlying memory blocks is retained by the caller, which must guarantee that they remain valid until the handler is called.]]

[[handler][The handler to be called when the write operation completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required. The function signature of the handler must be:

To read into a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   handle.read_some(asio::buffer(data, size));


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on reading into multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector. 



[endsect]



[section:overload2 windows::basic_stream_handle::read_some (2 of 2 overloads)]

Read some data from the handle. 

  template<
      typename ``[link asio.reference.MutableBufferSequence MutableBufferSequence]``>
  std::size_t read_some(
      const MutableBufferSequence & buffers,
      asio::error_code & ec);


This function is used to read data from the stream handle. The function call will block until one or more bytes of data has been read successfully, or until an error occurs.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more buffers into which the data will be read.]]

[[ec][Set to indicate what error occurred, if any.]]

]

[heading Return Value]
      
The number of bytes read. Returns 0 if an error occurred.

[heading Remarks]
      
The read\_some operation may not read all of the requested number of bytes. Consider using the 
[link asio.reference.read read]  function if you need to ensure that the requested amount of data is read before the blocking operation completes.

This function is used to write data to the stream handle. The function call will block until one or more bytes of the data has been written successfully, or until an error occurs.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[buffers][One or more data buffers to be written to the handle.]]

]

[heading Return Value]
      
The number of bytes written.

[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure. An error code of asio::error::eof indicates that the connection was closed by the peer.]]

  std::size_t write(
      SyncWriteStream & s,
      const ConstBufferSequence & buffers);


This function is used to write a certain number of bytes of data to a stream. The call will block until one of the following conditions is true:


* All of the data in the supplied buffers has been written. That is, the bytes transferred is equal to the sum of the buffer sizes.

* An error occurred.

This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's write\_some function.


[heading Parameters]
    

[variablelist
  
[[s][The stream to which the data is to be written. The type must support the SyncWriteStream concept.]]

[[buffers][One or more buffers containing the data to be written. The sum of the buffer sizes indicates the maximum number of bytes to write to the stream.]]

]

[heading Return Value]
      
The number of bytes transferred.

[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure.]]

]

[heading Example]
  
To write a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   asio::write(s, asio::buffer(data, size)); 


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on writing multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

[heading Remarks]
      
This overload is equivalent to calling:

[variablelist
  
[[d][The device to which the data is to be written. The type must support the SyncRandomAccessWriteDevice concept.]]

[[offset][The offset at which the data will be written.]]

[[buffers][One or more buffers containing the data to be written. The sum of the buffer sizes indicates the maximum number of bytes to write to the device.]]

]

[heading Return Value]
      
The number of bytes transferred.

[heading Exceptions]
    

[variablelist
  
[[asio::system_error][Thrown on failure.]]

]

[heading Example]
  
To write a single data buffer use the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  function as follows: 

   asio::write_at(d, 42, asio::buffer(data, size)); 


See the 
[link asio.reference.buffer buffer]  documentation for information on writing multiple buffers in one go, and how to use it with arrays, boost::array or std::vector.

[heading Remarks]
      
This overload is equivalent to calling: 

   asio::write_at(
       d, offset, buffers,
       asio::transfer_all());
